            <p>This page has an incredible animation as soon as you enter the page. The "Japanese style is perfectly obtained with the right typography as the Japanese street signs. The hamburger menu sends us to a very nice subpart of the site where we can find a nice summary of what we can finde in it. The complimentary colors look vivid and right for the viewer.</p>

            <p>The first animation as you enter the page is very well done and engaging. This page inmediatly has a very smooth and nice scrolling animation. This makes the reader to stop and read a little before going on with the page. I like the black and white, that combination always gives a modern and sophisticated look. The animations as you hover through the buttons are also a nice touch. I like how th epage changes color as you scroll down.</p>

            <p>This page is incredible at telling you what is about. As you look the top left corner, you can notice that it is about cryptocurrency and investment. This page also has a slow scrolling animation, and the colors are help the reader to asocciate the brand very quickly. There is a lot of powerful messages to the viewer that can make them join the brand. They talk a lot about the security, which is important, but in an entertaining way that anyone could understand.</p>

            <p>I LOVE the charging red bar at the beginning. It almost feels as something incredible is going to happen but givving it suspense. The effect in the home page is also incredible. The scrolling animation is a bit rare, but I like the originality. It shows that this person creates webpages, and their incredible. However, sometimes I feel as there is too much animation. Some information gets lost if a short span person is looking the web.</p>
